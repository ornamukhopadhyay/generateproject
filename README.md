# generateproject
**For the hackathon @ NewtonHACKS**

Created by Sarah Thomas and Orna Mukhopadhyay, this is a basic project generator which links to either topic databases, research papers, textbooks, or youtube videos for someone who chooses to further delve into a topic. 

This should encourage research and delving into scientific topics for people of all ages. 

*Improvements: *
  - Could have integrated into a Flask Website (could not for a lack of time); 
  - Could have utilized a database for the links; Could have utilized a larger selection of links; 
  - Used a more thorough project selection framework.
